# Snakes-and-Ladders-javaFX-
This was my 2nd year university project. I do not think i managed to make the code efficient enough, or made good use of classes really.
Nonetheless, sharing this project here is worth it, if only to learn and grow more from feedback or people's versions of this simple game.
